Each team will receive $1,200 in credits. For \u0026ldquo;Proof of Partnership\u0026rdquo;, they should upload a screenshot of the syllabus / an e-mail from Jay about the course. A 14-day Pro Trial begins (they can email josh.oynick@vercel.com with any issues). At the end of the trial, if the teams choose to remain on Pro and add credit card info, the credits will begin to draw down. If teams add payment info, they are strongly encouraged to set hard spending limits right away (documentation).
