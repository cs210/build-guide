 On Talking to Users
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#on-talking-to-users">#&lt;/a>

&lt;p>During our VC meetings this past week, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnlilly/">John Lilly&lt;/a> brought up a generalized observation: a lot of folks seem to be guessing about what customers might want. This points to something broader: the important balance in 210 between rapidly prototyping and building something end users want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As CS people, we all love going heads down and building as opposed to talking to people.

After all, it should be all about opinion-based design, right?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
