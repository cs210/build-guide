# General Advice

Below are some general tips, aggregated from industry experts and 210 alums.

## Buy first, not Build.

For initial functional prototyping and for most of the former part of your application's lifecycle, lean on existing APIs to do a lot of the heavy lifting. These models are already quite powerful and are able to handle almost all of the requests you send it. If certain users or design partners necessitate even more advanced functionality, though, consider working and finetuning your own LLMs.

## When unsure, lean on the literature. 

Oftentimes, issues with performance lie in the technical reports.
