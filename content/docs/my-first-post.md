[Team Documentation Examples](https://github.com/cs210/Home/blob/master/Resources/exampleTeamHome.md)  

**Vercel Credits**
* Students can create a Vercel Hobby account as soon as the class starts - Hobby accounts are always free  
* If they'd like to explore Pro features, we've set up "Stanford CS" as a category in the [Vercel Credits for Startups](https://vercel.com/startups/credits) application page. Each team will receive $1,200 in credits. For "Proof of Partnership", they should upload a screenshot of the syllabus / an e-mail from Jay about the course.  
* A 14-day Pro Trial begins (they can email josh.oynick@vercel.com with any issues).  
* At the end of the trial, if the teams choose to remain on Pro and add credit card info, the credits will begin to draw down.  
* If teams add payment info, they are strongly encouraged to set hard spending limits right away [(documentation)](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/spend-management).
